# Personal Landing Page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To practice React and combining React components together, I took my original Bootstrap page made with just HTML, CSS and Bootstrap [(see repo here)](https://github.com/gdwhittaker94/Bootstrap_website_practice/tree/main) and converted it into a React project! All the different parts of the webpage are individual components which are then combined within the App.js file - in typical ReactJS style. 

See the finished product below or check out the [live version here](https://react-bootstrap-landing-page-nine.vercel.app/).
